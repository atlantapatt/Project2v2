# Phase-2 Project

## Project Basis
In phase-2 of my Flatiron schooling I wanted to create something that could be seen in the real world. The most clear answer was to create a social media platform. The app is based on many of the most popular social media apps such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

## Project Use
At this moment, you can only post to the feed. You can travel between the login page, feed, post page, and userpage as well as logout. The other users are imported from a REST API. However, one day I want to increase the useability of the app further.
