# Phase-2 Project

## Project Basis
In phase-2 of my Flatiron schooling I wanted to create something that could be seen in the real world. The most clear answer was to create a social media platform. The app is based on many of the most popular social media apps such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

## Project Use
At this moment, you can only post to the feed. You can travel between the login page, feed, post page, and userpage as well as logout. The other users are imported from a REST API. However, one day I want to increase the useability of the app further.  

## How to Use
1. Log into the website using any username or password.

2. After logging in, you will be shown to the home page. To the left are more buttons to navigate the app as well as a list of friends. To the right is a list of friends who are online.

3. You can search for a specific user's post by using the search bar to search their username.

4. By clicking the photo in the top right corner, you can travel to the userpage. On the userpage is a API of random photos as well as filler text to represent userposts. To travel back to the homepage, press the 'Quacker' logo in the top left corner.

5. You can also post to the feed by clicking 'post' in the topbar. After typing your text, you can then click the 'post' button to post your message. It will appear at the bottom of the feed.

6. Lastly, you can log out by pressing the log out button on the left side of the screen above the friends list.
